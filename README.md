# SARS-CoV-2-variant-calling-web-tool-(2021)

## Overview

This repository contains a Web based SARS-CoV-2 variant caller based on article by Evans K. Rono <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.08.463334v2"> Covid-19 genomic analysis reveals clusters of emerging sublineages within the delta variant </a>. The tool was designed to identify genetic variations in sequences and has been based on the principles outlined in the referenced academic paper.

## Features

- Basic variant calling using the methodology from the academic article.
- Input in [specify input format].
- Output in [specify output format].

## Installation

[Provide instructions on how to install the tool, including any dependencies or requirements]

## Usage

To use the variant calling tool, follow these steps:

1. [Specify any pre-processing steps if necessary]
2. Run the tool with appropriate parameters.
   ```bash
   python variant_calling_tool.py [parameters]
   ```

## Parameters

- `input_file`: Path to the input file in [input format].
- `output_file`: Path to the output file where variant calls will be saved.
- [Any other relevant parameters]

## Example Usage

```bash
python variant_calling_tool.py --input_file input.fasta --output_file variants.vcf
```

## Acknowledgments

This tool is based on the academic article "[Insert Academic Article Title and Citation]". We acknowledge the authors of the academic paper for their contributions and the development of the methodology that served as the foundation for this tool.

## License

[Specify the license for the tool, if applicable]

## Contributing
